# Lab | Tableau Stories 1


In this lab, you need to start creating a Tableau story for the [Car insurance auto business case study](case-study_car_insurance_company.md). 

### Instructions

You should have all the plots, dashboards needed to start creating the story. Start with:

- Title story point. Add a background picture of your choice related to the business case and decide the background color for the story.
- Index story point 
- Use one story point to answer each of the following questions:
  - Which sales channel of the company has more claims. Add the sheet which has the plot to answer this question. 
  - Which is the most problematic vehicle class. Add the sheet which has the plot to answer this question.
  - Biggest claimant vehicle class by sales channel. Add the sheet which has the plot to answer this question.
  - Most problematic vehicle size ( in terms of claims ). Add the sheet which has the plot to answer this question.
  - Monthly fee over time. Add the sheet which has the plot to answer this question.
- Some considerations are worth taking into account. Decide the color scheme for the story from the beginning. Remember to use a high contrast color scheme. Be consistent and use the same color scheme in the whole story. Some ideas to decide the color scheme:
  - Use the color theory we covered in class. Feel free to select any color scheme.
  - Take the title background image and select the darker and lighter colors in the image to create a color scheme based on these colors. Use intermediate colors between the lightest and the darker color.
